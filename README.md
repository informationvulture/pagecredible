# pagecredible
A webpage preserver and database, with an attractive UI


## Information today, information tomorrow
Pagecredible is an application that is designed to preserve webpages and provid easy access to their viewing.


This project seeks to solve several issues and make life eaiser for those interested in this.


Q: Why don't you just save the webpages in a folder and then view it?
A: Originally I thought that would be the best idea, however, as more webpages get added, things can get chaotic. I'd like to be able to see if this page is still active, and view some relevant data while I'm viewing this archived page.

## Todos
I wish to use Python to get webpages and do some analysis. For the UI, I wish to use JavaScript to make it look professional.


## Future ideas
I hope that this app will be able to visually display pages.
